BUGS:
*-Shift selection doesnt work
-Move_COPYing blocks in global view can overlap two blocks, check for overlaps when seeing
if the block is valid too.
-While connecting cables, am i locking the undo system?
*-it is possible to click on a wrong colum in pattern editor
-move undostream locking to a safer place in automation stuff
-if shared block is the only one (after deleting) it is still reported
as shared because of the one at the undo buffer!
-stereo image.. make an histogram of sounds in l/r ?
-erase empty undo groups when finished
-resize block doesnt erase automation poitns!
-REWRITE THE DAMN GLOBAL VIEW!!
-mover eventos en la seleccion asi como en una curva, y editar la curva
